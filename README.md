# FuadeOS
Python CLI "OS"

# Post-download instructions
So, I've decided to completely scrap all of the previous instructions.  
These are the new ones.  
**Instructions:**  
After installing, run `apt update` to make sure the system is up to date.  
  
**What Changed?**  
Instead of having to download the base system (version 1.0) and to run the `apt update` command afterwards, I will now add more releases into the releases tab for newer versions instead of having you download 1.0 then update it to the latest version.  
  
Users on 1.0 WILL have to re-download the latest release in the release tab, as the `apt update` command no longer works on versions older than **1.1**.

# Commands
Run `help` for a list of commands.

# Installing packages
run `apt install <package-name>` to install packages, such as:
- echo (print anything to the console)
> Usage: `echo <text>`
- greet (greet anyone)
> Usage: `greet <name>`
