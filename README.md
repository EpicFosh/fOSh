# FuadeOS
Python CLI "OS"

# Post-download instructions
So, I've decided to completely scrap all of the previous instructions.  
These are the new ones.  
Instructions:  
After installing, run `apt update` to make sure the system is up to date.  
**What Changed?**  
Instead of downloading the oldest version and you running the update command, I will now add more releases into the releases tab for newer versions instead of having you download 1.0 then update it to the latest version.  

# Commands
Run `help` for a list of commands.

# Installing packages
run `apt install <package-name>` to install packages, such as:
- echo (print anything to the console)
> Usage: `echo <text>`
- greet (greet anyone)
> Usage: `greet <name>`
